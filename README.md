## About
> Journal Time! is a web app that allows users to journal and store entries online. The web app provides prompts and free-journaling options and saves all entries to unique user accounts. Users can indicate what kind of emotion they are feeling along with their entry submission. After each entry the user will receive one crystal, incentivising journaling. The crystals can be used to buy accessories within the website such as different prompt packages or website themes. Users can also view their past entries and filter by emotion or prompt type. Email notifications can be scheduled to remind the user to journal or sent if the account hasnâ€™t been used for 2 weeks. This project encourages journaling, which is a useful practice for mental health and wellbeing. It will also make the process more accessible and fun for the users.
